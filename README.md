# IPL-data-analysis
This project is about analyzing cricket match data using Python. It uses a dataset from the first innings of a match to understand how teams scored runs.

# What Project Does ?:
-- Finds out how many runs each team scored in total.

-- Counts how many 4s and 6s were hit during the match.

-- Shows how the runs increased ball by ball using cumulative sum.

-- Uses rolling mean to find the average runs over short periods, like every few balls or overs, to see if the team scored steadily or not.

# Tools Used:
-- Pandas – to read and work with the data.

-- NumPy – for numbers and calculations.

-- Matplotlib or Seaborn – for making graphs (if added).

# What I Learned:
-- How to use Python for sports data analysis.

-- How to find trends and patterns in how teams play.
